<p>
   I'm Blue Crafter. A South African YouTuber who posts gaming content and stop-motion.

<h2 id="starting-out">How I started out</h2>
<p>
The Blue Crafter channel (first called Yuki Gaming) was founded in 21 January 2021, Thursday, when I published <a id="normal-a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xOhQqsv4Yg" target="_blank">my first video</a>. I shared this video with everyone I knew and carried on publishing videos. I changed the channel name from Yuki Gaming to Yuki Gaming2279 and the Yuki Gamer. After a few months more, I changed the name to Blue Crafter (because there were <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5bM3qBR.png" id="normal-a" target="_blank">so many channels</a> named Yuki Gaming etc...). I kept the name and uploaded more videos. I soon made my second channel where I posted coding <a href="https://arduino.cc" id="normal-a">Arduino</a> and other things.
