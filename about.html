    <h1 id="started">How I started</h1>
    <p class="font-large-p">It was in 2020, when I got Minecraft for the first time of my life. I watched alot of Minecraft videos to figure out about some things about the game. One random day, an idea popped to my head: <br><i>"Why don't I become a YouTuber?"</i></p>
    <p class="font-large-p">
        I talked about it to my father and he was okay with it. I tried some apps for recording and editing but they were - were - not good. So I asked my relatives for some advice on what to use. They told about some good apps to use for recording and editing. I then nailed it down to the perfect two apps. I recorded a couple of videos but never published them. On 21 January 2021, the channels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xOhQqsv4Yg" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 183, 255)">first video</a> was published. I shared it to my family and they loved it. The channels name kept changing; from Yuki Gaming to Yuki Gaming2279 to Yuki Gamer to Yuki Gamer2279 to Glowsquid and then, to the name you all know today, Blue Crafter.
