    <h1>How I started</h1>
    <p>It was 2020 and I was bored and stuck in my house with nothing to do. Then, I was watching some videos on YouTube and idea popped in my mind<br><center><em id="quote">"Why don't I become a YouTuber?"</em></center><br>I started off in the spare room of my house with my phone being held up with cupboard pulling things recording a TV with my tablets screen on it. That wasn't working out so I went to my dad for some advice. He told me to use a screen recorder.<br><center>Remember:<br>I knew NOTHING about screen recorders and stuff like that</center><br>Then I shot a couple of EXTREMELY BAD videos. Then I asked my uncles for some advice, they told me that I should use an editor. I looked for one and fell in love with it immediatly. I was then ready to publish videos to YouTube (well not yet). I asked my dad if I can publish it and he said yes. I got so excited and went to my tablet to film a video. I hopped onto YouTube Studio and uploaded it there. This was <a href="links/first-video.html" target="_blank" id="first-vid">my first video</a>. It got a decent amount of views over the weeks and I uploaded video after video. For my birthday in May, I got an Arduino kit. This was when I made my second channel. Check that story out <a href="links/second-channel-about.html" id="blue2c-abt" target="_blank">here</a>.
